# The main driver for cac4teams
#
# What happens here is:
#
# - If it hasn't been done before, we copy the Microsoft Teams app
#   to /tmp/cac4teams
# - Use codesign to extract out the entitlements from Teams, and add
#   two new entitlements: com.apple.security.smartcard (for smartcard
#   support) and com.apple.security.cs.allow-dyld-environment-variables
#   (which allows us to inject the libcac4teams dylib) to the entitlement
#   file.
# - Resign the copied Microsoft Teams app with a new signature and
#   the extra entitlements.
# - Run the copied Microsoft Teams but inject the libcac4teams.dylib
#   to replace SecItemCopyMatching().
